## How to use this module

To use this module, we need to obtain the API key from Groq. Follow these steps:

1. First, create a Groq account or log in at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys).

2. Once on the API keys page, click the "Create API Key" button to create a new key.

3. A window will open where you need to:
   - Enter a reference name for the key (maximum 50 characters)
   - Complete the Cloudflare validation

4. Click the "Submit" button to generate the key.

5. The API key will be displayed on screen. Use the "Copy" button to copy it.

**Important**: Make sure to save the key in a secure place, as you won't be able to see it again after closing this window.
